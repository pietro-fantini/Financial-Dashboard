**Problem**: Prior to Amazon I worked in a gearbox company. It was a very traditional Italian company, not very keen to innovation and without a huge data culture.

**Solution**: One day I managed to put my hands on the financial data of the whole company and I created this dashboard. The day after I was speaking with the general manager, which was amazed.

**Structure**: The dashboard is fully interactive, even switching from one sheet to another can be done by clicking the buttons on the left. Every metric change according to the applied filters. I created 5 views to visualize the data from different perspectives: overview, by branches, by customers, by time period and by geography.
